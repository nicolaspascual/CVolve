# CVolve
A job seeker assistant powered with NLP

## Goal of the project

CVolve pursues the possibility to offer the users an augmented experience in the task of applying for a job. If we think on splitting the process of landing a job into smaller steps, we could find the following ones:

1. **Try to find job offers that fit as much as possible your expectations.** If we want to find our dreamt job, it is likely that we would have to scroll down for a very long time in a given job portal reading dozens of offers to choose just a bunch of them and discarding a lot that didn't suit us at all.
2. **Adjust our resume to the selected offers.** It is important to remark our most valuable skills taking into account the requirements of each offer. This means that we will be creating more than one CV, which means spending some time per each offer, knowing that many of them may be discarded by the recruiters, and we will just land a job, so just one resume will be worth it.
3. **Applying to the selected offers.** Last step is the most straight forward. We just fill the form of the company, attach our resume, click on submit and wait for the (not so quick) answer. After applying, we keep doubting if the recruiter will be conformed with the content of the resume, either if we have missed something or added too much information, ...

If this process is done manually, it is easy to see that it leads to a huge waste of time for the applicant, as well as the possibility of missing good job options because of the fatigue generated by searching too much, or maybe the underestimation of the resumes by the applicants because the content could be improved, ...

We are awared of all these disadvantage, that is why we have developed CVolve.
